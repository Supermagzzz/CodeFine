        <b>We are greeting you in our app!</b><br>
        Nowadays it contained three parts.<br>
        <hr>
        <b>Basics</b><br>
        In this course, you will learn C++ basics and will be able to create simple programs. This course is recommended for beginners who have no background in programming.<br>
        <hr>
        <b>Algorithms </b><br>
        This course was created for those who had experience in C++ and want to work as a programmer, prepare for studying in the university or participate in competitions (for students of universities or schools/colleges). Here you will learn how to solve practical tasks, such as how to find the shortest way between two cities, find words in text or area of a polygon. Besides, you will learn how to estimate the program’s speed and chose the fastest algorithm for your task.<br>
        <hr>
        <b>Data structures</b><br>
        If you have a well-understanding of graphs, dynamic programming, and press-function - this course is for you. In this course, you will learn how to write fast and optimized code, get knowledge about data structures for fast information research, understand how to find flows in networks. Using this course you will increase your level in programming and get a chance to have a job in big IT-companies or participate in high-level competitions.<br>

        <p>
        All lectures and examples of code are available in C++ (one of the most common programming language) now, but we will add Java, Python, C#, and Kotlin soon. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="h">How to use this app?</div>
        <hr>
        You should understand that this app is an interactive tutorial for programming. It’s unnecessary to spend time in theory specifically, you can read articles whenever you want (even in metro). For making the learning process effective you should pay a lot of attention to examples of code. We will give you a test after new themes. You can check your progress and understanding there. After solving you can see the result and have a retest. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Every lesson has that with practical tasks which give an opportunity to write code by yourself. We highly recommend to solve them! It is the only way to get programming skills. You only need a computer with internet access and free time for this. Also, you can programming on the phone if it is more comfortable. For solving tasks you should make an account on codeforces.com (or just log in) and join our group with tasks. All instructions for software installation you will find in the second lecture of <b>Basics</b> course.
        </p>
        <p>
        After solving, put a tick in a special square near the text of the task. After, you will see progress on the main screen.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you cannot solve a task, you can read the explanation where we will explain the solution and show the program's code. We will give you easy tasks to build upon what has already been achieved and hard questions to learn lessons deeply and apply your knowledge in mathematics. If you can't solve a problem, you will learn a lot from our explanation and solve the same type of tasks next time. Task solving is a key element of learning.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our app is in active development. The third course is almost finished, we will add new programming languages soon, make the opportunity to discuss tasks and lessons, create our own website. In contrast to others, our course is absolutely free and has lots of tasks. Our app is more comfortable than books because we have a system which will check your answers. For free access to this app, we had to add ads. We are asking for understanding. We will really appreciate having donations or if you pay for the version without advertisements. 
        </p>

        <b>We hope that you will enjoy programming! </b>
